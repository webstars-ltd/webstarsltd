                Because both the ReMetrica product and the webinar series are
                aimed at a very specific audience with unique pains and
                challenges, we knew that our messaging was crucial to achieving
                success, and had to be personalised and precise. We spoke to
                Aon’s reinsurance team and ReMetrica customers to deepen our
                understanding of not just the features and benefits of the
                ReMetrica product, but also what business challenges it solves -
                and how Aon’s expertise could also help solve those challenges.

                In a period where ‘webinar fatigue’ was becoming a real
                challenge for digital events, our strategy had to make the
                ReMetrica webinar series stand out from the rest, while also
                reaching our target audience through the right channels. Along
                with a highly targeted LinkedIn campaign, we also ran
                advertisements through third-party publishers that Aon had
                long-standing relationships with, and that we knew the audience
                was likely to be reading.

                As long-time practitioners of email marketing, the email portion
                of the campaign was also a great opportunity for us to sink our
                teeth in. We A/B tested two versions of email copy for the
                initial invite - one ‘corporate’ version, and one ‘disruptive’
                version - to understand how best to engage with our audience and
                cut through the noise.
